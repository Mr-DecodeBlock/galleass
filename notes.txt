### Creating a new Contract, you'll need to add it to:
```
tests/compile.js
tests/deploy.js
tests/galleass.js publish()
tests/publish.js
app/App.js?
```



### Exporting all layers to files (the alphabet/citizen from psd)
```
File -> Scripts -> Browse
~/Photoshop something something/something.jsx
run
(script comes from https://github.com/jwa107/Photoshop-Export-Layers-as-Images)
```



### Events Parsing
```
Set DEBUG_SYNCCITIZENS to true to see how bad it is
I have a new event parser built and I should integrate it into Galleass
```
