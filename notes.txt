### Creating a new Contract, you'll need to add it to:
```
tests/compile.js
tests/deploy.js
tests/galleass.js publish()
tests/publish.js
app/App.js?
```



### Exporting all layers to files (the alphabet/citizen from psd)
```
File -> Scripts -> Browse
~/Photoshop something something/something.jsx
run
(script comes from https://github.com/jwa107/Photoshop-Export-Layers-as-Images)
```



### Events Parsing
```
Set DEBUG_SYNCCITIZENS to true to see how bad it is
I have a new event parser built and I should integrate it into Galleass
```



### Possible Changes
```
Citizen chars are uint16 but you could have more if you use uint8
Citizen status should probably be uint16
```


### Before Staging
```
NFT modal (when you click your ship in your inv)
Timber should pay waaay slower
All tokens can be bought and sold in market
Maybe grass and mountain tiles could also produce resources like the timbercamp?
```

## Once staging
```
Transactions should show up in bottom left to give progress bars to non-ship button clicks
Make sure all things link to etherscan correctly
```
