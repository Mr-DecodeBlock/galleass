# TODO

[ ] figure out how to get the contract verified on etherscan (I think clevis will need to output the full source code before it's compiled)
[x] fishing png doesn't have flag right, I think there needs to be a fishing east pic
[ ] make event parsing scale.. start with latest and work your way backwards to block number
[ ] can you detect metamask changing accounts and reload?
[ ] scroll should follow user
[ ] buttons should follow user
[x] there is an edge case where someone could reload the page after casting their line and their bait / baithash is lost (cookies?)
[ ] ^ add a 'cut line' button that sends in the bait hash 0x0
[ ] draw different types of fish
[ ] add in fake land tiles just to see how it will look
[ ] clicking on an inventory item should probably bring up a send modal asking for an address and how many to send? does meta mask have that built in?
[ ] when you switch accounts in Metamask it should detect the account changed and reload or something
[ ] reimplement the multibutton green thumbs up and then green arrow for embark
[ ] oceanfront.png is too large, needs to be optimized
