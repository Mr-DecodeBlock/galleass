# TODO

[x] fishing png doesn't have flag right, I think there needs to be a fishing east pic
[ ] make event parsing scale.. start with latest and work your way backwards to block number
[ ] can you detect metamask changing accounts and reload?
[ ] scroll should follow user
[ ] buttons should follow user
[x] there is an edge case where someone could reload the page after casting their line and their bait / baithash is lost (cookies?)
[ ] ^ add a 'cut line' button that sends in the bait hash 0x0
[ ] draw different types of fish
[ ] add in fake land tiles just to see how it will look
