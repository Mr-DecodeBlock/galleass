# TODO
[ ] bug with centering the buy ship button over the harbor seems to happen when harbor is right next to small island with left edge
[ ] bug where buy ship button appears when it shouldn't both at load and after you buyship and you are waiting for embark button
[ ] clicking on an inventory item should probably bring up a send modal asking for an address and how many to send? does meta mask have that built in?
[ ] scroll should follow user
[ ] buttons should follow user
[ ] ^ add a 'cut line' button that sends in the bait hash 0x0
[ ] galleass.eth points to ?
[ ] button to cut line when getting revert or whatever on reelin
[ ] figure out how to get the contract verified on etherscan (I think clevis will need to output the full source code before it's compiled)
[x] favicon - title
[x] https on galleass.io
[x] warning message when on any major network other than ropsten
[x] ipfs deployment
[x] fishing png doesn't have flag right, I think there needs to be a fishing east pic
[x] make event parsing scale.. start with latest and work your way backwards to block number
[x] can you detect metamask changing accounts and reload?
[x] there is an edge case where someone could reload the page after casting their line and their bait / baithash is lost (cookies?)
[x] draw different types of fish
[x] add in fake land tiles just to see how it will look
[x] when you switch accounts in Metamask it should detect the account changed and reload or something
[-] reimplement the multibutton green thumbs up and then green arrow for embark
[x] oceanfront.png is too large, needs to be optimized
