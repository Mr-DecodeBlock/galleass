# TODO

[ ] fishing png doesn't have flag right, I think there needs to be a fishing east pic
[ ] make event parsing scale.. start with latest and work your way backwards to block number
[ ] can you detect metamask changing accounts and reload?
[ ] scroll should follow user
[ ] buttons should follow user
[ ] there is an edge case where someone could reload the page after casting their line and their bait / baithash is lost (cookies?)
